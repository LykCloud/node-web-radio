# Node Web Radio

> node-web-radio - radio station for nodejs, this example is for the main radio-station library.

### Why ?
The ability to broadcast radio from a server without a launcher makes it possible to fully automate and control the order of tracks and this is just an example, the official documentation can be found in [radio-station](https://github.com/prohetamine/radio-station), please note that you can also conduct live broadcasts by voice, as on a real radio using [launcher-web-radio](https://github.com/prohetamine/launcher-web-radio)

### Get started

Clone the github repository and install nodejs.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:prohetamine/node-web-radio.git
